keadatabase-back
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greenstone/keadatabase-back.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greenstone/keadatabase-back)

Setup
-----
This guide assumes that `python3`, `pip`, `postgres` (with postgis) and virtual
environments are installed.

`./manage.py` commands should be run from the `src/` directory.

For instructions on setting up PostGIS:
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/>

1. Setup `python3` virtual environment
2. Create a new database 'keadatabase' with username 'postgres' and no password
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `./manage.py migrate`
5. `./manage.py createsuperuser`

Running
-------
`./manage.py runserver`

Testing
-------
Ensure that the `keadatabase_test` db is able to be created before running.

`./manage.py test`

Data synchronisation
--------------------
These steps assume you have `mdbtools` installed.

1. Create a directory 'data/' and add the `kea_be.mdb` file (back-end to the Access kea database).
2. From the current directory run: `./export_kea_be.sh`. This will export three CSV files into the `data/` directory.
3. Run `./manage.py synchronise`

Data synchronisation is non-destructive (it will not delete objects).

Deploying
---------
This code is deployed using a continuous integration workflow. Code pushed to master will be deployed to Heroku after Travis CI tests are passed. The process takes a few minutes.

Please note, aside from `collectstatic` Django commands such as `migrate` are not run automatically.

Layout
------
* `test_data/` - Sample CSV data used for testing purposes
* `src/birds/` - Bird models and helpers
* `src/keadatabase/` - Project settings
* `src/locations/` - StudyArea models and helpers
* `src/synchronise/` - Command and helpers that syncs Django DB with provided CSVs
* `src/theme/` - Django REST Framework customisations
* `src/sightings/ - All sightings related information, including links to Bird objects
* `src/report/` - The only non-read-only API endpoint, used for POSTing sightings
