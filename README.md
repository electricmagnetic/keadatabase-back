The GeoDjango-based back-end for the Kea Database <https://keadatabase.nz> citizen science project.

Setup
-----
This guide assumes that `python3`, `pip`, `postgres` (with postgis) and virtual
environments are installed.

`./manage.py` commands should be run from the `src/` directory.

For instructions on setting up PostGIS:
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/gis/install/postgis/>

Required packages: `binutils`, `libproj-dev`, `gdal-bin`, `postgresql-x.x`, `postgresql-x.x-postgis`, `postgresql-x.x-postgis-x.x-scripts`, `postgresql-server-dev-x.x`, `python3-psycopg2`

1. Setup `python3` virtual environment
2. Create a new database 'keadatabase' with username 'postgres' and no password
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `cd src`
5. `./manage.py migrate`
6. `./manage.py createsuperuser`

NB: To create database, login as postgres user then run `createdb keadatabase` in bash shell and `grant all privileges on database keadatabase to postgres;` in the psql shell. You may need to adjust your pg_hba.conf settings for no password access.


Running
-------
`src/manage.py runserver`


Testing
-------
Ensure that the `keadatabase_test` db is able to be created before running.

`src/manage.py test`

You can get code coverage reports:
1. Installed `coverage` with pip
2. `coverage run src/manage.py test src`
3. `coverage report`


Data synchronisation: Bird, BandCombo, StudyArea
------------------------------------------------
These steps assume you have `mdbtools` installed.
1. Create a directory 'data/' and add the `kea_be.mdb` file (back-end to the Access kea database).
2. From the current directory run: `./export_kea_be.sh`. This will export three CSV files into the `data/` directory.
3. Run `./manage.py synchronise`

Data synchronisation is non-destructive (it will not delete objects). On production data files will need to be added to S3 before import.


Importing database dump
-----------------------
To import a database dump from Heroku run the following command as the `postgres` user:
`pg_restore --clean --no-owner --role=postgres -d keadatabase <file>.sql`


Data synchronisation: Region, Place
-----------------------------------
1. Obtain datasets for Region (merged copy of NZ regions dataset), and Place (SI-only NZ Placenames)
2. Import datasets into a local version of the kea database using `./manage.py loadregions` and `./manage.py loadplaces`
3. Dump data using `./manage.py dumpdata locations.place`and `./manage.py dumpdata locations.region`
4. Upload data to the keadatabase S3 bucket
5. `heroku run bash` then wget the data and run `./manage.py loadddata <filename>`


Data synchronisation: GridTile
------------------------------
1. Obtain three datasets for GridTile (polygons as EPSG:4326, min/max points as EPSG:2193) as shapefiles
2. Temporarily modify the GridTile model on a local version of the kea database to enable `null=True` on min/max fields (discard migrations afterwards)
3. Import datasets into the local version of the kea database using `./manage.py loadgridtiles`
4. Remove temporary `null=True`from models
5. Dump data using `./manage.py dumpdata locations.gridtiles`
6. Upload data to the keadatabase S3 bucket
7. `heroku run bash` then wget the data and run `./manage.py loaddata <filename>``


Sightings import
----------------
To import sightings data from a provided CSV:
1. Create a directory 'data/' and add an appropriately formatted `sightings.csv` file
2. Run `./manage.py importsightings`

Format:
`name,email,phone,date_sighted,time_sighted,comments,sighting_type,longitude,latitude,precision,number,location_details,behaviour,import_id`

Example:
`John Smith,contact@example.org,2018-01-01,12:00:00,,sighted,172.3188943,-43.5127894,200,1,"Cathedral Square",,csv_john-smith_2019-02-17_1`


Deploying
---------
This code is deployed using a continuous integration workflow. Code pushed to master will be deployed to Heroku after Travis CI tests are passed. The process takes a few minutes.

Please note, aside from `collectstatic` Django commands such as `migrate` are not run automatically.


Layout
------
* `test_data/` - Sample CSV data used for testing purposes
* `src/bands/` - Band models and helpers
* `src/birds/` - Bird models and helpers
* `src/keadatabase/` - Project settings
* `src/locations/` - StudyArea models and helpers
* `src/report/` - The only non-read-only API endpoint, used for POSTing sightings
* `src/sightings/` - All sightings related information, including links to Bird objects
* `src/synchronise/` - Command and helpers that syncs Django DB with provided CSVs
* `src/theme/` - Django REST Framework customisations
* `src/geojson/` - Provides a GeoJSON endpoint of filterable sightings
* `src/surveys/` - Provides the kea survey tool functionality


Bug reports
-----------

Should be filed on the Kea Database Trello board (not presently public)
